# Waterloo Course Tools

Waterloo Course Tools is a small plugin for coding agents that helps Waterloo students keep course information in sync across Learn/Brightspace and Piazza.

It packages reusable skills for downloading Learn materials safely, discovering external course webpages, and checking Piazza posts from an authenticated browser session.

## Quickstart

Give your agent Waterloo Course Tools: [Claude Code](#claude-code), [Codex](#codex).

## How It Works

Waterloo courses often split information across Learn/Brightspace, external course webpages, and Piazza. This plugin gives your agent two focused workflows:

1. `uwaterloo-learn-download` discovers the current student's Learn enrollments, downloads course materials through D2L APIs, and protects local edits with a manifest.
2. `waterloo-piazza-fetch` uses `browser-use` with a logged-in browser session to join, check, and summarize Piazza course information.

The skills are designed to avoid course-specific hardcoding. Learn courses are discovered from the logged-in account, and external material pages are selected from announcement/TOC context rather than fixed hostnames or course names.

## Requirements

- Python 3.
- `browser-use` CLI for Piazza workflows and browser-backed Learn checks.
- A browser session logged in to the relevant UWaterloo Learn/Piazza account.

Install or verify `browser-use` before using the Piazza skill:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://browser-use.com/cli/install.sh | bash
browser-use doctor
```

The Learn downloader script uses Python standard-library HTTP APIs, but it expects valid Learn-only cookies exported from an authenticated browser session.

## Installation

Installation differs by harness. If you use both Claude Code and Codex, install Waterloo Course Tools separately for each one.

### Claude Code

This repository includes a Claude Code marketplace file at `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`.

Register the marketplace:

```bash
/plugin marketplace add WayneWei228/waterloo-course-tools
```

Install the plugin:

```bash
/plugin install waterloo-course-tools@waterloo-course-tools
```

Validate locally from a clone:

```bash
claude plugin validate .
```

### Codex

This repository includes a Codex plugin manifest at `.codex-plugin/plugin.json`.

Install from the GitHub repository with a Codex marketplace installer:

```bash
npx codex-marketplace add WayneWei228/waterloo-course-tools --plugin
```

If you clone the repository locally for development, validate the plugin with:

```bash
python3 /path/to/plugin-creator/scripts/validate_plugin.py .
```

## The Basic Workflow

1. **Authenticate** - Open the relevant UWaterloo Learn or Piazza account in a browser profile your agent can access.
2. **Export Learn-only cookies** - For Learn syncs, export only cookies scoped to `learn.uwaterloo.ca` or its subdomains.
3. **Sync Learn materials** - Run the bundled Learn downloader against a workspace root. It writes `learn_content/`, mirrors course folders, and protects local edits with `_manifest.json`.
4. **Inspect external material candidates** - When a course links to an external material page, review `learn_content/<COURSE>/_external_candidates.json` and let the agent choose the real material source semantically.
5. **Check Piazza** - Use `browser-use` to inspect joined classes, join a class only after explicit user approval, and write a dated Piazza snapshot.

## What's Inside

### Skills

- **uwaterloo-learn-download** - Downloads UWaterloo Learn/Brightspace course materials, discovers enrollments dynamically, protects local edits with a manifest, and records external webpage candidates.
- **waterloo-piazza-fetch** - Uses `browser-use` to inspect Piazza classes, join requested course Piazza pages, and summarize high-signal course posts.

### Scripts

- `skills/uwaterloo-learn-download/scripts/fetch_learn_materials.py` - Stable Learn material fetcher used by the Learn skill.

## Privacy

This plugin is designed so course data stays local:

- Do not commit Learn cookies.
- Do not commit downloaded course materials.
- Do not commit Piazza snapshots that contain private course, access, or personal information.
- The Learn workflow filters exported cookies to `learn.uwaterloo.ca` and its subdomains only.

## Development Checks

Run these before publishing:

```bash
python3 /path/to/plugin-creator/scripts/validate_plugin.py .
python3 -c "import py_compile; py_compile.compile('skills/uwaterloo-learn-download/scripts/fetch_learn_materials.py', cfile='/tmp/fetch_learn_materials.pyc', doraise=True)"
```

Also scan for sensitive or environment-specific content before publishing:

```bash
rg -n "(/Users/|C:\\\\Users\\\\|/home/|learn_cookies|cookies\\.json|door code|password|secret|token)" .
rg -n "\\b[0-9]{7}\\b" skills/
```

Review any matches manually. Seven-digit numbers can be legitimate examples, but they can also be real Learn org-unit IDs or course-specific identifiers.

## Contributing

This project is early and currently focused on Waterloo Learn/Brightspace and Piazza workflows.

1. Fork or branch the repository.
2. Keep workflows general across Waterloo students and terms.
3. Do not add course-specific hardcoding as the default path.
4. Validate the plugin and skills before opening a PR.

## Updating

Push updates to this repository and update or reinstall the plugin from your agent harness.

For Claude Code:

```bash
/plugin marketplace update waterloo-course-tools
```

For Codex, rerun the repository install command or use your local Codex plugin update flow.
